# Draggable

> This is still a work in progress! Some basic window maangement features are a little broken and task management needs some work.

Just a quickly-hacked-together JavaScript window manager. Stylized as a 90's window manager, but it could easily be stylized into something much more modern. This is based off a tutorial from w3schools on draggable elements. I've expanded it to function a little like a window manager.

This could be used (and re-skinned) for use on other web apps where windowed activities are necessary.
