# Hoddle
> This is still a work in progress! Some basic window maangement features are a little broken and task management needs some work.

Hoddle (named after Melbourne's [Hoddle Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoddle_Grid)) is a quickly-hacked-together JavaScript window manager. This is based off a tutorial from w3schools on draggable elements. I've expanded it to function a little like a window manager.

This could be used (and re-skinned) for use on other web apps where windowed activities are necessary.

## Features

- [x] Movable windows
- [x] Taskbar or dock
- [x] Task Management
- [ ] Batch Processing
- [ ] Integration with local storage
- [ ] Convert into library for use on other sites

## Inspired by...
Hoddle was influenced by [poolside.fm](https://poolside.fm/) and [Windows 93](https://www.windows93.net/), and other web apps that use some form of basic window management like the old versions of [Pixlr Editor](https://pixlr.com/e/).
